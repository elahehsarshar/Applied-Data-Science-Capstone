# Applied Data Science Capstone

This repository contains the work and findings from the Applied Data Science Capstone project, which is a part of the IBM Coursera Data Science Specialization.

## Overview

The primary focus of this project was to analyze SpaceX launch data, exploring various factors that influence the success rate of launches. The analysis delves deep into the intricacies of launch data, providing insights into the spatial relationships of launch activities, the significance of launch sites, and the correlation between payload weights and success rates. This project allowed for hands-on practice in the IBM Cloud using real data science tools and real-world data sets.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Utilized tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Dash, and Folium to create interactive visualizations that offer a dynamic way to analyze launch site data.
  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Used Folium to create interactive maps highlighting launch sites, their success rates, and their proximity to significant landmarks like railways, highways, and coastlines.

- **Predictive Analysis**: Implemented machine learning models, including Decision Trees and SVM, to predict the success of SpaceX launches based on various features.

- **Comprehensive Presentation**: The repository includes a PowerPoint presentation that encapsulates the findings, methodologies employed, and the insights derived from the analysis.

- **Hands-on Practice**: The project was conducted in the IBM Cloud using Jupyter notebooks, GitHub, Watson Studio, and real-world data sets, offering a practical approach to learning data science.
